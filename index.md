## Welcome to the this tutorial site. It contains all necessary information to learn about this tutorial.

### Description

Fine-grained opinion mining (also called aspect-based sentiment analysis) aims at extracting knowledge about opinion targets (aspects), opinion holders and the opinions/sentiments expressed towards them, leading to structured opinion summaries. This task proves to be more crucial and challenging by providing a thorough analysis of an opinionated text, yet is under-discussed in the community compared to overall sentiment score classification. This tutorial aims at reviewing existing works in this field that covers 3 main subtasks, namely aspect-based sentiment classification, aspect-related extraction and summarization. We introduce various model constructions, including feature-based, rule-based and deep-learning-based models, that focus on exploiting complex word-level interactions among an input text and promote the generality of these methods to be adopted for efficient knowledge extraction. Besides single-domain studies, a further step is to explore cross-domain, cross-lingual and multi-modal strategies. Although much more challenging, these alternatives promote the development of fine-grained opinion mining, because there are only limited resources available with fine-grained annotations in real industries. We introduce a few existing studies and aim to provide more insights towards these cutting-edge research directions.
